## mt19937 random number generator

The purpose of these tests is to assure that random generated numbers are cross platform consistent.

Two tests are included, running the same distributions used in Cell2Fire, but changing the origin of the random library.

One uses boost::random the other std::random.

These tests can be manually run on 

- https://github.com/fdobad/C2F-W/actions/workflows/mt19937_std.yml 

- https://github.com/fdobad/C2F-W/actions/workflows/mt19937_boost.yml 

as they have a workflow_dispatch directive.

### example of running locally

```bash
cd test/tech
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 mt19937_std.cpp -o mt19937_std
./mt19937_std | tee mt19937_std.txt
g++ -std=c++11 -O2 mt19937_boost.cpp -o mt19937_boost -lboost_random -lboost_system
./mt19937_boost | tee mt19937_boost.txt
diff mt19937_std.txt mt19937_boost.txt # not expected to be the same!!
```

## Results

As of 2025-12-02 Only boost is cross platform consistent! 

When std::random get's consistent then boost dependency can be dropped easing the building times and dependencies!
